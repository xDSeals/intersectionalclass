The goal of Cenk and Kyle is to give a platform to progressive Democrats that are uncorrupted by corporate/PAC money. TYT cant lash out because each reporter is their own person. TYT reporters tend to be pretty passionate, nothing wrong with both sides being presented. We shouldnt run from debates about the merits of JD.

Ro responded to the criticisms. He accepts personal donations up to 2700 per person. He supports some sort of public funding for elections system. Also, he represents the district Silicon Valley is located in. Is it really a surprise that the young, progressive, semiwealthy workers in SV would donate in droves to Ro based on his policy positions?

The correct way forward is by making America the place where companies want to be headquartered. By promoting and incentivizing the hiring of American workers and subsidizing research and innovation.

We dont prosper by attacking large companies, and encouraging them to leave the United States and invest elsewhere.

That way no company can have actual profit, it goes back into the employees, unless they actually plan the money to expand/hire more.\n----CODE HERE FOR CONTEXT----",https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/6p8hls/but_raising_the_minimum_wage_hurts_business/dknwfkj,126,LateStageCapitalism,2017,9,0,advocacy & political,political,Left,3,,3,21958,103855,35.46254875,7594.700245,-3000.030139,143736.1711,27.65555823,Scavenger53,6004.238286,81116.08194,39.50697674,215,,20.93023256,17.6744186,7.441860465,0,117.7301625,,588.6508123,,588.6508123,1500935972,,4,6,4,,,,,,,,,,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,03774b62-b8c7-47ee-9d02-4971e66b9f88

Where one person can have the wealth, and or income of 1000 Americans, they do not buy the same amount of goods that those 1000 Americans would.

Demand not supply is what creates jobs. More discretionary income in the hands of those that spend money the most will create the most jobs. This means those with little savings and spend the vast majority of their paycheck on necessities. Give them a bump in pay and more jobs will be created.

What is actually cruel about raising taxes for the wealthy? Will they be put in a position of not being able to afford any necessities? Will they not be able to buy their next yacht?

Lets be clear though with how bannon wants this to go is to shift a tax burden from the middle class to the rich. Keeping the tax income roughly neutral and or likely wanting to end up hurting the poor in the process. The middle class has some savings typically and or is in a position to save if they live within their means, the poor for the most part do not.

* Taxes
* ""nonproduction"" workers
* Shareholders
* Accumulation of capital ie. business expansion
* Politics

What I see is wrong is a disproportionate amount of this is directed towards shareholders or massive wages at corporate level nonproduction workers. Taxes are negligible as huge amounts of time and effort is devoted to dodge it. Another issue with this extraction of value is that it allows massive companies to spend this surplus on buying political systems to circumvent the inconvenience of a democratic voting system. Our growth is stunted because so few people are responsible for the management of the wealth that workers produce.

This is not democracy, this is a plutocracy that we are living in. I want workers as a whole to be responsible and step up to the plate of managing our own lives instead of being dictated to by a bunch of wankers that never have to work a hard day in their lives.

Also I frankly dont give a shit if a specific worker consents. It doesnt change that fact that they are being exploited.

And itll be a glorious thing when the required workforce drops by 50% but everyone is still paid their value. Work becomes voluntary at a later point.

But to the point of everyones needs being met, a UBI shouldnt be necessary. You need food, you go to the supermarket and walk out with what you need. Housing wont be a commodity, you get a place to live based on your desires (you want a city house or a rural house, etc) and whats available. You need electric and internet, etc, and cant afford it, well guess what? That infrastructure is now community owned and operated. Theyll likely have programs available. The government also might assist with such. You need work, well thats a guaranteed right now along with leisure. Just see what volunteer jobs need done and do it. Pave a road. Mow a park. But its voluntary and on an as needed basis and you will be paid. And who knows, maybe there will eventually be a UBI, but it has to be a democratic decision.\n----CODE HERE FOR CONTEXT----",https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/6l6w5a/st_louis_minimum_wage_to_revert_from_10_to_770/djrrham,294,socialism,2017,1,2,advocacy & political,political,Left,1,,1,10504,61443,44.47701121,11528.83068,-4278.760144,134951.2826,17.327637,SilverBolt52,-28421.75658,163731.6095,24.24864865,370,LateStageCapitalism,26.48648649,71.62162162,60.81081081,0,557.2893446,,3678.109675,3009.362461,668.7472136,1499188095,2,12,16,6,,,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,f67153f8-3f3e-4687-8e6a-aea68544c84f

Its an infuriating double standard that racism is only racist if happening to nonwhites, and its totally acceptable to racistly take advantage of blanket labelling an entire race as long as its the white one, for certain past actions of a minority of despicable rich leaders, not all of whom were white. 

To me, that seems like the pinnacle of racism, being excused by those profiting from it, while hypocritically protecting only themselves from the same thing.\n----CODE HERE FOR CONTEXT----",https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/6iemq5/socjus_people_showing_sympathy_for_otto_warmbier/,183,KotakuInAction,2017,2,0,advocacy & political,issue,Right,4,,4,14851,289758,38.06619317,5065.827838,-25326.05668,157110.4727,15.52451011,Dead-Eyes,51277.23516,142937.6409,74.98591549,71,,63.38028169,8.450704225,0,8.450704225,,,187.8287002,187.8287002,,1498030792,6,-6,48,9,,,,,,,,,,6,4,2,0,0,0,0,0,,4,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0cc8fb3c-d21e-48ee-bc02-73f7353dec12

 Conservatives sometimes focus on policy while ignoring when the left throws character attacks. The reason that the left does this is because it resonates with more people (who arent that bright) and helps them to control the debate by labelling their opponent.

Capitalism is equalism...  everything is a commodity.

&amp;nbsp;

* ***No*** *capitalism is not as presently run compatible with a Natural Law society. (Red Pill)*

&amp;nbsp;

However...

If you looked at the 1800s where they had a different view it did work.

This was before welfare, before Child Support laws, before Divorce Rape, before women voting.

In a **true** Natural Law condition then it is in alignment with Natural Law and works perfectly.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically they destroyed Capitalism with the creation of Fractional Reserve Banking in 1914.  Once all these inverted circumstances got control Capitalism has mutated into something ugly.

The Founding Fathers believed Capitalism was good **as long as it followed Natural Law**.

The Founding Fathers even wrote into the Constitution that Fractional Reserve Banking wasnt supposed to exist as money was supposed to be owned by The People and not the banking elites.

&amp;nbsp;

* *July 4 was supposed to celebrate the break from the Bank of England. (Rothschilds)*

&amp;nbsp;

Realize that on the fourth of July now we celebrate a ""lost liberty"".

Its sad to see people talking about our great ""freedom"" when weve already lost most of it.

And the worst part is how clueless the beta males are they have been made into slaves.

A once relatively free land (America) is now mostly enslaved by the Globalist Tyranny.

We really need to wake up folks.

Logically, that is moronic. If there were no illegals to do the job, the employers would have to pay min wage.  So any place illegals are, employers would rather hire them and save money.

Thus when they budget their jobs, they assume they will be paying x amount under minimum wage.

They dont want to hire the more expensive American workers.  The cost of hiring an american to do the illegals work is ""too high"" for them,  thus they drive down cost of labor.

Offices are usually open for a very small period of time that often interferes with the average Joes 95 and I also believe that most laws have some sorta monetary stipulation (AKA a modern poll tax, something that was meant to be outlawed via an amendment back in the Civil War to avoid a socioeconomic bias but came back due to this type of law), it is especially prevent in the African American and Hispanic American due to the fact that they end up having to work longer hours as a result of systematic racism present in many areas where these ethnic groups arent part of the winning political partys Coalition. This has a domino effect that gives a bias towards certain wealthy and/or white voting blocs.

Private insurers have gotten it down to a science. You can be where ever you want just be ready when its almost your time to see a doctor meaning you waste little to no time.

An election is rigged if the scales are tipped in an undemocratic fashion.

Even if you think its reasonable, using superdelegates or closed primaries to tip the outcome of an election towards an establishment candidate is a form of rigging.  The election becomes less democratic in an effort to exercise a mild/moderate degree of control over the possible outcomes.

Clearly an outsider or antiestablishment candidate could still win, but the exclusion of independents from certain state primaries and the use of superdelegates makes it less likely, and intentionally so.

This creates immediate tension between the groups because they are not being treated fairly.

In addition, and as an unintended consequence of trying to help out black students, the students who get into elite schools with the help of AA have a much higher dropout rate than students that get in without standards being lowered, when they would have been more likely to succeed in schools that corresponded to the academic ability.

 /
 The unemployment rate is extremely low. It is currently at 4.3%, which is a 16 year low.

And the U6 rate is also low, which measures both unemployment and underemployment. It is currently at 8.6%, which is about the area it was before the recession in 2007 and lower than it was for most of the 2000s. And U5, which includes discouraged workers, is at the level it was prerecession. The Labor Participation Rate is low, but that has a lot more to do with the demographic changes from an aging population with more people being to old to work.

All of this implies that we are at full employment. We are starting to see labor shortages, so we are likely to start to see wages start to rise and see some inflation.

Yet politicians are still engaging in ""bring jobs to America"" style of politics. Is this still convincing to Americans? \n----CODE HERE FOR CONTEXT----",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/6rkh42/does_the_politics_of_bringing_jobs_to_america/,170,PoliticalDiscussion,2017,36,36,advocacy & political,political,Diverse,1,1,,8926,75687,61.81685098,16599.58296,-5937.719878,128385.8533,8.86333188,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,4223.964844,141853.2409,64.3045067,821,PoliticalDiscussion,66.86967113,90.13398295,14.85992692,0,56.82463916,,1117.551237,473.5386597,644.0125772,1501853436,6,-12,12,3,,,,,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,39558dd4-4b46-4f4e-bef9-20294c1ca7a1

At that point, you could also eliminate the wage selling price floor (minimum wage) and allow workers to sell their labor freely in an open market for jobs that might not even exist at $15/hr. This solves many of the marketdistortions that our current system suffers from while still keeping a social safety net and allowing the chance for young and lowskilled workers to work towards a better career as they develop needed job skills.

Police officers interviewed were unable to properly identify what sexual abuse even constitutes under the law. And some of them even raped the girls themselves.

The Card study is frequently cited by prominimum wage individuals. Other economic studies find the opposite. The [Seattle study]), which uses the best source of data by far (actual tax returns of workers given by Washingtons state government), but hasnt yet been peer reviewed, matches the Card study with regards to *restaurant workers* but finds an overall decrease in employment for low skilled workers (restaurant or otherwise).

You can also make [theoretical objections]) to the Card study/ minimum wage more generally, which I personally find as compelling as the empirical ones.

Now we seem to equate minimum wage with ""minimum amount an employer is willing to legally pay.""

Why get caught up in the reasons why someone does nothing but minimum wage work? That detracts from the core issue of whether we want essential, lowwage workers to live in abject poverty or not. In a nation as wealthy as the US, do we want to punish lowwage workers and humiliate them for doing hard or unglamorous jobs?

I think our resistance to living wages for low wages positions gets at a deep national psychological fear of failure. If we punish those with the least resources, then no matter how hard those in better positions fail, theyll still be better of than those poor, lowwage workers at the bottom.

Its an illogical mess that is simply trying to cover up the fact that it really is an establishment clause violation.\n----CODE HERE FOR CONTEXT----",https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/6ini10/the_trump_administration_made_its_final_plea_to/dj9bbda,128,law,2017,2,0,advocacy & political,political,Diverse,1,,1,4028,18281,45.17597506,7796.702112,-20125.63842,128085.5639,5.458563536,joeshill,-1985.760643,92749.55199,53.48963731,386,law,40.15544041,87.04663212,8.031088083,0,145.2995593,,145.2995593,48.43318642,96.86637284,1498154803,,-9,11,5,,,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,307a9cdb-484e-459b-a456-705aec984ad4

That doesnt change the reality that, in a pure capitalist system, rural areas get screwed.

Regulation (or even better, a public option) is the only realistic proposal to fix this. Its a confusing situation where rich cities are voting to have more of their taxes go to rural areas for more equal healthcare, while rural area fight back in hopes of going back to getting ripped off instead.

Id agree that people are being dicks about it, but theres a real sense of bafflement and resignation that if thats what rural areas really want maybe they should get it. \n----CODE HERE FOR CONTEXT----",https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/6o56y4/now_that_the_repealonly_plan_has_collapsed/dkf06mf,112,PoliticalDiscussion,2017,4,0,advocacy & political,political,Diverse,1,,1,22098,284196,48.74508438,17942.69581,750.8035352,131983.2633,8.801165393,Speckles,12691.94095,194127.5113,51.28667791,593,PoliticalDiscussion,24.28330523,69.30860034,44.01349073,0,164.4033801,32.88067603,657.6135205,98.64202808,558.9714925,1500464942,2,7,17,1,,,,,,,,,,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,352e42f6-1f8d-4cfe-85be-16cf274cbf4a

One of my friends was going home over winter break to see her dad in Montana. Free food and board. I had some savings and a little Christmas money, so I spent like $250 on my plane ticket and like $50 on my day pass at Big Mountain. I dont think that puts me in any kind of elite status. I worked 2 jobs all through college and saved. 

Ironically, my copay for my ACL reconstruction and all the phys therapy ended up costing far more than the trip. Im American, and the ice pack pump thing *alone* was $400. Thats when I first encountered credit card debt. 

Anyhow, today I understand that even daily life could put me thousands of dollars in debt if I have an accident or an illness. At the time, not anticipating a serious injury, it seemed like a relatively good price for 2 weeks in the snow with a friend. 

Edit: Im from AZ, which also maybe underscores the appeal of Montana snow
