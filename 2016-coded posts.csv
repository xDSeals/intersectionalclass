In todays climate, we are not allowed to openly criticize black culture in any way without inviting accusations of racism, founded or not.)  However, what I mean in this context is that a white person lecturing black people about their shortcomings isnt likely to be very wellreceived or effective.  Its a bit like when rich people disparage poor and working class people for not being richer, ignoring the fact that many aspects of our economic system punish the poor, favor the rich, and make economic mobility more and more difficult all the time. Its like a slap in the face.  I mean, we know the American people are getting poorer, and the middle class is shrinking rapidly.  Obviously, its not just individual personal character flaws that are causing this.  Its a systemic problem that the rich are benefiting from, complicit in, and in some cases, conscientiously designing.  So for them to blame the working and the poor while simultaneously befitting from the system that screws us over is just too hard to swallow.  The perception of a white person finger wagging at black people would be very similar, and even people who may be perfectly guilty of the cited indiscretions and entirely deserving of said chastening, will have an understandable excuse for ignoring it.

I agree with you on this. I feel like the government has been less and less responsive over the past 20 years to the concerns of working class Americans. And it seems like theyve grown content to pay lip service to this key demographic without showing much interest in enacting beneficial change.

Im hoping that this election cycle will demonstrate that theres a large constituency of individuals across party lines that prioritize economic wellbeing over ideological squabbles. And Im hoping that this will become a concrete movement, not just a flash in the pan.

Im not sure how likely that is. Youd have to check with sociologists on that one.

What I do know it that were entering an era of radical global change, and we need to stay ahead of it. Western hegemony is weakening, the age of AI and rampant job automation is quickly approaching, and thinking nationally isnt going to cut it anymore. I want to know who is going to prepare us for that.

The simple facts are: (1) Bernie opposed the Panama Free Trade Agreement because he thought it would greatly increase the ability of the super rich to engage in legalized tax evasion and Hillary endorsed it; (2) plenty of scholars have articulated how free trade agreements greatly increase the ability of the super rich to engage in legalized tax extortion; and (3) the Panama Papers reveal that the super rich have engaged in legalized tax extortion.  The casual link is all but crystal clear. Your head is in the sand if you honestly think the Panama Free Trade Agreement has had no impact on the ability to engage in exactly the behaviors that Bernie said it would and the Panama Papers demonstrate happened.

FDR being one our most progressive, liberal presidents, and Scalia being one of the more conservative judges: One put citizens in camps, the other believes we must not allow the law to fall silent in the times of war(like we did when FDR rounded up the japanese)

And that often the idea of voting for someone because of their party for reasons like voting for Hilary to prevent a Republican from nominating judges is silly, because the differences between many candidates is extremely nuanced, especially in this election.

I mean, Trump and Bernie agree on a lot, but differ on methods of execution(bureaucracy vs free market)

Cruz and Hilary and the now defunct Bush agreed on quite a bit if you remove social issues from the table essentially the entrenched corruption camp.

And Rubio wants to rip up the Constitution and have the States come together to write a new one.

I mean, depending on what issue you care about the most, theres a lot of cross the aisle options in this election.

While Smith was convinced that the market would provide economic equality to all, Ricardo kinda saw that people who already owned important resources (see:land) would just continue to dominate the economic sphere.

The neoricardiaian school would give rise to the ""multicentric organizational model"" which critiques the market system in claiming powerful organizations (rather than rational individuals in the market system) would be the primary actor in the economic system, and use that authority to enrich the powerful elites which commanded them.

The PRC has as much of a functioning democratic apparatus as the USA does with local peoples congresses and a multiparty parliament.

However, the violence exercised in the name of that state and its ideology is no different from that exercised by any bourgeois state for their ideology except insofar as it contained proletarian content along with bourgeois in their ""New Democracy"". It just seems like were more ""free"" in the west because a) there is less of a threat to the ruling forces than existed in the newly established revolutionary states and b) the structural violence is normalized so to be almost invisible or seem natural.

Im not proMao or a MarxistLeninist but the idea they created nightmare states bent on serving a small elite and enslaving the people is rooted in liberalism.

I doubt you will find many conservatives that reject the most basic form of nationalism and patriotism.  One of the recent problems with the word nationalism is it is a term used to describe the international movement towards candidate like Trump or Marine Le Pen.  They are often described as right wing or a part of the conservative movement despite the fact that they have many disagreements with fundamental conservative principles such as free trade.  In addition to this they often care very little about economic issues such as taxes or the free market.  They may use common conservative talking points about the economy but they tend to not really be committed to those issues such as Trump who claims in his tax plan that he wants to lower taxes for everyone and then recently says he is going to raise taxes on the rich. \n----CODE HERE FOR CONTEXT----",https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/4gfagy/whats_wrong_with_nationalism/,166,Conservative,2016,3,0,advocacy & political,political,Right,1,,1,14302,133158,39.64361135,11266.81801,-9193.076389,137912.0584,10.52014149,BcTsarIvan,-22241.68126,132924.6935,46.0483871,124,metacanada,34.67741935,33.87096774,4.838709677,12.09677419,,,1225.91944,525.3940455,700.525394,1461644813,3,5,17,4,,,,,,,,,,7,1,0,0,0,6,0,0,,1,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,4,,,,,07a3ec3a-92f8-4855-8e95-4b013971c864

Sorry to say,even the 1950s American patriarchy so many dudes idolize was only wallpapering feminine promiscuity. Plenty of bad boys , mobsters, and execs were banging John Q Husbands wife. The older women merely covered their tracks better.

For all the blatant hypergamy modern women partake in, at least its in the open. Back in the 50s youd likely only find out the truth when your wife was banging the CEO by the way, divorced men back then also got slandered as being failures themselves.

Good job ignoring the fact that the UK and Germany also pay significantly less than the US.

You realize that 5 of the worlds 10 largest drug companies are in countries that guarantee their citizens healthcare. Drugs are routinely developed in, and sold to nations with universal healthcare.

You can still charge an income based ""copay"" which would really be a penalty to prevent overutilization in a capitation system.

My experience is that rich people with Cadillac insurance plans treat us more like their servants while poor people on Medicaid are often grateful.

I dont know if hes colluding actively with Paul Ryan and reigning Republican establishment. Cruz is someone theyve outcasted for both political and policy reasons. He wants to get rid of every subsidy, and 10% tax rates are, again, scary for the centerleft and centerright. Remember, Rand Paul, someone who ideally wants nearly 0% tax rates, recognizes the impracticality of that suggestion (he proposes 15%). Its definitely, for American standards, as far out on coocoo land as Bernie Sanders tax rates.

With that said, Kasich is definitely the establishments guy policy wise. I think theyve largely ignored him in the public due to pragmatic reasons (the reasons you guys are mentioning, he has no real shot). Although, I think there is a very strong possibility hes staying in just to be an AntiTrump weight. His gravity in the voting booth is minimal, but it can tip the scale in Cruzs favor.

When you are employed by someone, you give them more economic value than you get out of the relationship, and you turn over many of your freedoms to boot.

It doesnt help that rich people arent generally subject to the same market forces, e.g. layoffs or pay cuts, that workers are subject to. Many rich people in executive positions de facto cannot even be fired for poor job performance, whereas the worker can be fired for any reason or no reason. Also many rich people inherit wealth, which puts them outside the meritocracy that workers live in.

While such trade has brought up incomes in those *other* countries, in a relative sense theyre still generally poor, having their resources leached from them via ""free trade"".

Its not just about this case, but about the manufacturing sector, as a whole, in the US.  Why is there such a large Walmart demographic?

We all get that white people are stopped by cops. I was a longhaired teenager  cops stopped me frequently. I was a personable teenager who knew numerous cops in town, so when I was stopped I usually managed to turn it into something funny, but it didnt mean I wasnt frequently stopped.

However, I could have cut my hair and all of that stopped. As you mentioned, well off white people are infrequently stopped by cops, because they typically dont look like criminals because theyre dressed like well off white people.

However, well off black people still tend to get stopped by cops, because theyre still black.

I see headlines like ""Trump threatens riots."" Totally made up bullshit to try to scary people away from Trump. Exactly what the media has been doing for months. What he said was if he had like 1.1k delegates and the next person had 500 then he doesnt see how he doesnt get the nomination automatically. If they were to take it away from him he said there could be riots. Which is true. There could be riots. He didnt call for it.

If Bernie had 95% of the delegates needed to win the dem nomination and Hillary had like 30% and Bernie came out and said ""I dont see how I dont get the nomination. I think if the elites took it away from me there would be riots."" Its the same thing.

I see this as related because it might be a good idea, but it wouldnt work.  Even if it were possible, I would argue that it should be based on living standard and location of the primary residence, not on race.  But it wont work because in the most poorly deprived communities you not only have a lack of qualified recruits but if they are of good quality they want to move their families somewhere decent.

So rich areas would be easy, but ...
